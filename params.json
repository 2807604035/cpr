{"name":"cpr - C++ Requests","tagline":"Curl for People","body":"C++ Requests is a simple wrapper around [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl) inspired by the excellent [Python Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) project.\r\n\r\nDespite its name, libcurl's easy interface is anything but, and making mistakes misusing it is a common source of error and frustration. Using the more expressive language facilities of C++11, this library captures the essence of making network calls into a few concise idioms.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick GET request:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <cpr.h>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n\r\nint main(int argc,  char** argv) {\r\n    auto r = cpr::Get(Url{\"https://api.github.com/repos/whoshuu/cpr/contributors\"},\r\n                      Authentication{\"user\", \"pass\"},\r\n                      Parameters{{\"anon\", \"true\"}, {\"key\", \"value\"}});\r\n    r.status_code;                  // 200\r\n    r.headers[\"content-type\"];      // application/json; charset=utf-8\r\n    r.text;                         // JSON text string\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's [less functional, more complicated code, without cpr](https://gist.github.com/whoshuu/2dc858b8730079602044).\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nC++ Requests currently supports:\r\n\r\n* Custom headers\r\n* Url encoded parameters\r\n* Url encoded POST values\r\n* Multipart form POST upload\r\n* File POST upload\r\n* Basic authentication\r\n* Digest authentication\r\n* Timeout specification\r\n* Asynchronous requests\r\n* :cookie: support!\r\n* Proxy support\r\n\r\n### Planned\r\n\r\nSupport for the following will be forthcoming (in rough order of implementation priority):\r\n\r\n* [Usage and documentation](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr/issues/20)\r\n* [PUT methods](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr/issues/21)\r\n* [DELETE methods](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr/issues/22)\r\n\r\nand much more!\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install is to use cmake:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ..\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, the embedded libcurl is used by this library. If you want to use your system libcurl, then run:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncmake -DUSE_SYSTEM_CURL=ON ..\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nA successful build should produce a single library archive that you can link against your project. You should also make the include directory visible to your build as well so that you can include [cpr.h](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr/blob/master/include/cpr.h).\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nThe only explicit requirement is a C++11 compatible compiler such as clang or gcc. The minimum required version of gcc is unknown, so if anyone has trouble building this library with a specific version of gcc, do let me know.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis library is very much in a pre-alpha stage. Please don't attempt to use this in any serious or critical production environment. If you do use it and find bugs you'd like to report, see below!\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease fork this repository and contribute back using [pull requests](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr/pulls). Features can be requested using [issues](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr/issues). All code, comments, and critiques are greatly appreciated.\r\n","google":"UA-50612882-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
